                    Am currently working in an MNC i.e Accenture. I have had the experience of being a part of team where requirements were given managers.
                    Since One year I Have been working directly with the client who give requirements over a call and together we brainstorm to come up with a solution. In my current role there is no hierarchy of managers or team leads.
                    I even work with Other organisation people i.e TCS directly on a daily basis.
                    I can even advice people for a smooth transformation from Waterfall to AGILE.
