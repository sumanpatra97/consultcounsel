                    I have been a part of Deloitte consulting for about 2 years working on different projects based on healthcare and insurance consulting. I have a keen interest on smart home automation based on devices like Alexa and google home. I also am a computer geek searching for the specs for high end gaming. Played a lot of games and watched a lot of animes.
                    Consult me on based on smart home tech, gaming, computer issues
                    Also mobile photography and editing on snapseed.
