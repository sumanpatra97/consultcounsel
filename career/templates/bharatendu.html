                    I have been drawing since I was 4 years old. Previously I was on drawing with my pencil colours and markers. For the past 3 years, I have been drawing digitally. I have used multiple tools, hardwares and softwares for drawing. I have used a wacom digital tablet and currently using Android tablets.
                    I have working knowledge in Photoshop and multiple drawing tools such as Krita and Autodesk Sketchbook.
                    I have a YouTube channel for Art that I have started recently and my Instagram contains almost 300 of my artworks.
                    My field of expertise includes digital art, pencil colours, markers and ink pens. I have been fortunate to win multiple awards for my drawings and creativity though out my life. I can guide you with basics of drawing and cartooning and how you can easily approach digital art.
