                    This is a small town guy who just loves to spend his life playing all kinds of sports especially Cricket, which is my first love.
                    I would like to motivate the next gen kids in whichever way possible to take up outdoor physical sports.
                    I was playing some sport or other wherever I am. I was the school cricket team captain, captained my College Volleyball team in my Undergrad, was a part of Infosys MySore DC volleyball team and currently playing for the Infosys Hyderabad cricket team.
                    I love to take care of my body as it helps me in performing well in the games I play.
