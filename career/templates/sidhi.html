                    Currently, I am working as an application development analyst with Accenture where I am a contractor in British telecom. I can help you understand how to acquire different skill set and automate various things around. My basic skill is selenium with Java.
                    Apart from this, I love dancing, writing and playing basketball. I was very young when I started learning odissi as a special activity and basketball as a lead up activity in my school.
                    I could also provide you some knowledge on content writing as well as I have written few blogs in my site thyessence.wix.com.Bloging is my favourite pass time as it helps me pen down my feelings. I could also provide you knowledge about Various MUN i.e Model United Nations and how does it function and how should you take up countries and do your research.
