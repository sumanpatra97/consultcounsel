                    Having worked earlier in a Direct Selling Organization as a "Business Associate" (part-time) during my graduation and in my own Startup "Archify & Buildify Constructions Pvt. LTD. " after graduation, I realized that there are more things I want to explore and nail, specially in the fields of Management, business, marketing and strategy.
                    This paved my way towards Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar as a MBA grad.
                    Throughout my journey I have seen people getting confused about a career in Management and Business , because of the pre notions that they need talent and skills to nail it. My goal is to guide them breaking the status-quo and help them explore the unexplored.
